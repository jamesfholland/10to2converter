10to2converter
==============

Converts list of signed decimal numbers to binary (sign-and-magnitude, 1's complement, 2's complement). It shows conversion process as if done by hand.

This was created for my ECE238L class at UNM. It was quicker for me to write a program to do my homework for me than to do it by hand.
